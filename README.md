## Hello everyone üëã
My name is Norbert Bielak and I'm a Computer Science student from Poland with passion to embedded programming.

* üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working as a freelancer with Arduino using Espressif32 systems. 
* üöß My main side project is YPVS driver.
* üå± I‚Äôm currently learning STM32 (CubeMX HAL), RTOS, CMake.
* ‚ö° Fun fact: I was trying to learn a lot of technologies (WebDev, GameDev, Mobile) but still embedded is my favourite. Frontend is propably in second place.

## üèçÔ∏è Hobbies
Apart from coding I enjoy riding enduro motorcycles, car & motorcycle mechanics, electronics and everything about rockets and space flights üöÄ
